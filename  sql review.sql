-- WARM UPS & REFERENCE                                          --
-------------------------------------------------------------------

-- 1. View entire table:
SELECT * FROM products;

-- 2. Only 10 rows from table:
--    In PostgreSQL:
SELECT * FROM products LIMIT 10;

--    In SQL Server:
-- SELECT TOP(10) * FROM products;

-- 3. Only 2 columns from table:
SELECT title, price FROM products;

-- 4. Order by a column:
SELECT * FROM products ORDER BY price;

-- 5. Order by a column descending:
SELECT * FROM products ORDER BY price DESC;

-- 6. Distinct values in column:
SELECT DISTINCT price FROM products;

--------------------------------------------------------
-- EXERCISES: Answer using the techniques from above. --
--------------------------------------------------------

-- 1. Write a SQL query to view the entire 'users' table.

select * from users;
-- 2. View the first 5 rows of the 'users' table. 

select * from users limit 5;
-- 3. View the 'users' table ordered by when the users was created.
select * from users order by created_at;

-- 4. Write a SQL query to view the entire 'purchases' table.
select * from purchases;

-- 5. View the name and state columns of the 'purchases' table.
select name,state from purchases;

-- 6. Use LIMIT and ORDER BY to see the 10 most recent purchases. 
select * from purchases order by created_at limit(10);
select * from purchases order by created_at desc limit(10);
-- 7. Use a DISTINCT query to see which states people have made purchases from. 
select distinct (state) from purchases;

----------------------------------------
-- EXTRA CREDIT: If you finish early. --
----------------------------------------

-- 1. You can use DISTINCT on multiple columns as well.
--    Use DISTINCT on the purchases table to see which states each user has made orders from.
select distinct (name, state) from purchases;
-- 2. Modify the query above to ORDER BY user_id, so you can see the data user-by-user
-- select distinct order by users_id from purchases;
